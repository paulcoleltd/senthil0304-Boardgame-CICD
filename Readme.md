I'm absolutely excited to share my recent DevOps project for Java applications! 

🚀This isn't just a pipeline - it's a full-blown, end-to-end CI/CD masterpiece! 🌟🎉

 🛠️ Key technologies and tools used:

🔧 Jenkins: Open-source CI/CD automation server with extensive plugin support.
☕ Java JDK: Java Development Kit for compiling and running Java applications.
🏗️ Maven: Build automation and project management tool for Java projects.
🔍 SonarQube: Tool for continuous code quality inspection and vulnerability detection.
🔒 Trivy: Open-source security scanner for containers and file systems.
📦 Nexus: Repository manager for storing and distributing build artifacts.
🐳 Docker: Platform for developing and running containerized applications.
☸️ Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform for automated deployment and scaling.
☁️ AWS: Cloud platform providing a wide range of services for computing, storage, and networking.
🌳 Git: Version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
📊 Prometheus: Open-source monitoring system for collecting and querying time series metrics.
📈 Grafana: Visualization platform for creating customizable dashboards from various data sources.

 Here's a breakdown of my pipeline:

🔍 Git Checkout: Pulls the latest code from the main branch.
🛠️ Compile: Compiles the Java code using Maven.
🧪 Test: Runs unit tests with Maven.
🔬 File System Scan: Performs a security scan of the file system using Trivy.
🔍 SonarQube Analysis: Analyzes code quality with SonarQube.
🚦 Quality Gate: Checks if the code meets quality standards.
📦 Build: Packages the application with Maven.
📤 Publish to Nexus: Uploads the built artifact to Nexus repository.
🐳 Docker Image Build: Creates a Docker image of the application.
🔬 Docker Image Scan: Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities using Trivy.
📤 Docker Image Push: Pushes the Docker image to a repository.
🚀 Deploy to Kubernetes: Applies Kubernetes manifests to deploy the application.
✅ Verify Deployment: Checks the status of pods and services in Kubernetes.
📧 Email Notification: Sends an email with the pipeline status and report
